		<p>You were a child,
			crawling on your knees toward it.
			Making mama so proud,
			but your voice is too loud.
			We like to watch you laughing.
			You pick the insects off plants.
			No time to think of consequences.
		</p>
		<p>Control yourself.
			Take only what you need from it.
			A family of trees wanting,
			To be haunted.
			(x2)
		</p>
		<p>The water is warm,
			but it's sending me shivers.
			A baby is born,
			crying out for attention.
			Memories fade,
			like looking through a fogged mirror
			Decision too
			Decisions are made and not bought
			But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot.
			I guess not.
