		<p>You were a child,
			crawling on your knees toward it.
			Making mama so proud,
			but your voice is too loud.
			We like to watch you laughing.
			You pick the insects off plants.
			No time to think of consequences.
		</p>
		<p>Control yourself.
			Take only what you need from it.
			A family of trees wanting,
			To be haunted.
